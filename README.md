# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Modelling-using-ML
“Built a machine-learning model to predict heart disease risk using a 1.3M-record clinical dataset. Performed data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, and model comparison, achieving approx 85% accuracy with Random Forest and strong ROC-AUC performance.”
